<H2>Welcome</H2>
<P>Thanks for stopping by, this is the website for the              book 
Artificial Intelligence for Games by Ian Millington              and John Funge, 
published by Morgan Kaufmann in 2009.</P>
<P>This site contains the errata for the book, in a              browsable 
expandable way (there may not be much there yet,              because the book 
just got published). You can also see              other books we recommend, and 
keep up to date with any              news on the book.</P>
<P>But most likely you're here to get the source code              for the book. 
The source code is open-source and hosted by              GitHub. You can find 
it by clicking "Source              Code" at the top of the page.</P></DIV>

<H3>Source Moved to GitHub</H3>
<P>March 6, 2010</P>
<P>The source code accompanying this book has been                  moved to 
GitHub from google code. This is because it                  is far easier for 
you to get hold of the code and play                  with it when it is hosted 
on a distributed version                  control system. It doesn't make much 
sense, I                  don't think, to have open source projects hosted       
           on a centralised version control system.</P>
<P>You can find the code at                   <A href="http://github.com/idmillington/aicore">http://github.com/idmillington/aicore</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
